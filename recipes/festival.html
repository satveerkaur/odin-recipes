    <p>This Jamaican Festival recipe makes a sweet and delicious side dish (similar to Jamaican fried dumplings), that goes perfectly well with popular Jamaican food like Escovitch Fish, Jerk Chicken and Jerk Pork.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup refined yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold milk or cold coconut milk</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 - 4 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil for dough</li>
        <li>2 -3 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add flour, salt, baking powder, cornmeal, and sugar then use a large spoon to combine ingredients thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Measure and combine water and milk.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the flour mixture and add ¼ of the water and milk mixture then lightly stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add another ¼ of the water and milk mixture and knead dough lightly before adding the remaining liquid.</li>
        <li>Knead lightly until the dough is soft and smooth. If dough is sticky add a bit more flour.</li>
        <li>Rub cooking oil over the dough before using a damp paper towel or kitchen towel to cover the bowl.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>After 1 hour, remove the dough from the fridge and dust lightly in flour.</li>
        <li>Pinch off a portion of the dough and roll into a sausage shape about 4 inches long, then gently pull on both ends to slightly stretch. Lay your festival on a clean baking tray or cutting board.</li>
        <li>Continue to pinch and form your dough and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil, on medium-high in a large wide frying pan, ensuring the oil level is about 2 inches deep. In 1 - 2 minutes, test the oil for readiness by sprinkling in a pinch of flour. The oil is ready when tiny bubbles form around the flour. Immediately add some pieces of dough to the hot oil.</li>
        <li>Monitor the festivals closely for signs of ‘browning’ on the sides. Turn the festivals as necessary until golden-brown all over.</li>
        <li>If the festivals start browning too quickly, lower the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Remove the festivals when they are completely brown in colour.</li>
        <li>Place the festivals on a thick sheet of paper towel to absorb the excess oil.</li>
        <li>Bless up and enjoy them!</li>
    </ol>
